## Overview

The Skin Wellness Navigator is an advanced tool designed to assist in the early detection and assessment of skin conditions. By combining AI technology with NIH clinical datasets, it provides instant analysis of skin lesions and offers evidence-based recommendations.

## Getting Started

### Using the Analysis Tool

1. **Upload Your Image**
   - Click "Browse Files" or drag and drop an image
   - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, JPEG
   - Ensure good lighting and clear focus in your images
   - Avoid using filters or editing the images

2. **Analysis Process**
   - The system will automatically process your image
   - Analysis typically takes 10-15 seconds
   - Progress bar shows real-time processing status

3. **Understanding Results**
   - Classification (Benign/Malignant)
   - Confidence score
   - Risk level assessment
   - Similar cases comparison
   - Stage distribution analysis
   - Personalized recommendations

### Interpreting Results

#### Classification Categories

- **Benign**: Typically non-cancerous lesions
- **Malignant**: Potentially cancerous lesions requiring medical attention

#### Confidence Levels

- **High (>80%)**: Strong prediction confidence
- **Medium (50-80%)**: Moderate prediction confidence
- **Low (<50%)**: Uncertain prediction

#### Risk Levels

- **Low Risk**: Regular monitoring recommended
- **Medium Risk**: Follow-up with healthcare provider advised
- **High Risk**: Immediate medical consultation recommended
